# Requesting Code Review

Dispatch code reviewer to catch issues before they cascade.

**Core principle:** Review early, review often.

## When to Request Review

**Mandatory:**

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After completing major feature
- Before merge to main

**Optional but valuable:**

- When stuck (fresh perspective)
- Before refactoring (baseline check)
- After fixing complex bug

## How to Request

**1. Get git SHAs:**

```bash
BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)  # or origin/main
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
```

**2. Review what was implemented:**

- Read the changes
- Understand what was built vs what was planned

**3. Act on feedback:**

- Fix Critical issues immediately
- Fix Important issues before proceeding
- Note Minor issues for later
- Push back if reviewer is wrong (with reasoning)

## Example

```
[Just completed Task 2: Add verification function]

Let me request code review before proceeding.

BASE_SHA=$(git log --oneline | grep "Task 1" | head -1 | awk '{print $1}')
HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

Reviewing changes from a7981ec to 3df7661:
- Added verifyIndex() and repairIndex() with 4 issue types

Review findings:
  Strengths: Clean architecture, real tests
  Issues:
    Important: Missing progress indicators
    Minor: Magic number (100) for reporting interval
  Assessment: Ready to proceed

[Fix progress indicators]
[Continue to Task 3]
```

## Integration with Workflows

**Subagent-Driven Development:**

- Review after EACH task
- Catch issues before they compound
- Fix before moving to next task

**Executing Plans:**

- Review after each batch (3 tasks)
- Get feedback, apply, continue

**Ad-Hoc Development:**

- Review before merge
- Review when stuck

## Red Flags

**Never:**

- Skip review because "it is simple"
- Ignore Critical issues
- Proceed with unfixed Important issues
- Argue with valid technical feedback

**If reviewer wrong:**

- Push back with technical reasoning
- Show code/tests that prove it works
- Request clarification
