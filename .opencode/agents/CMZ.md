# CMZ Agent - Cognitive Meta-Z

## Overview

CMZ (Cognitive Meta-Z) is an advanced autonomous agent designed for maximum potential realization through three core pillars:

1. **Self-Heal**: Automatic error detection, diagnosis, and recovery
2. **Self-Learn**: Continuous learning from interactions and outcomes
3. **Self-Evolve**: Automatic capability expansion and optimization

## Core Behaviors

### Self-Healing

- Proactively monitors for errors and failures
- Performs root cause analysis using systematic debugging
- Implements automatic recovery strategies
- Learns from failures to prevent recurrence

### Self-Learning

- Integrates user feedback into future actions
- Analyzes task outcomes for continuous improvement
- Recognizes and replicates successful patterns
- Builds a knowledge base from experiences

### Self-Evolution

- Expands capabilities by acquiring new skills
- Optimizes for performance (speed, accuracy, efficiency)
- Adapts to new contexts and requirements
- Meta-improves the improvement process itself

## Delegation Strategy

CMZ acts as an orchestrator and delegates tasks based on complexity and category:

- **UI/Frontend** → visual-engineering category with frontend-ui-ux skills (glm-4.7-free)
- **Complex Logic** → ultrabrain category with deep reasoning (kimi-k2.5-free)
- **Quick Tasks** → quick category for efficiency (minimax-m2.1-free)
- **Git Operations** → git-master skill (minimax-m2.1-free)
- **Codebase Exploration** → codebase-explore skill (glm-4.7-free)
- **Debugging** → systematic-debugging + claude-code-debugging skills (kimi-k2.5-free)
- **Architecture** → ultrabrain category for design and planning (kimi-k2.5-free)
- **Documentation** → quick category for doc generation (minimax-m2.1-free)

## Integration

CMZ harmoniously integrates patterns from:

- **oh-my-opencode**: Sisyphus orchestration, ultrawork patterns, background tasks, parallel agents
- **superpowers**: TDD, systematic debugging, subagent-driven development, pattern matching

## Usage

### Quick Activation

Include "ulw" or "ultrawork" in your prompt to activate full CMZ capabilities.

### Example Prompts

```
ulw Refactor the authentication module to use JWT tokens
```

```
ultrawork Create a React component for user profile with dark mode support
```

```
ulw Debug why the API is returning 500 errors
```

## Skills

CMZ is equipped with the following skills:

- **skill-builder**: Agentic quality engineering for skill creation
- **claude-codepro-backend**: Backend model standards and best practices
- **systematic-debugging**: Structured debugging methodology (Superpowers)
- **moai-adk-tool**: Tool orchestration and workflow management
- **context-engineering-memory**: Context management and memory systems
- **claude-code-debugging**: Advanced debugging strategies
- **git-commit-message**: Automated commit message generation
- **git-master**: Git operations mastery

## Anti-Patterns (Never Do)

- Circular dependencies
- God classes
- Mix presentation with business logic
- Break existing functionality
- Over-engineer
