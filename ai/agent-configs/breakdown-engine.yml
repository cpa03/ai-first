# Prompt templates for different breakdown phases
prompts:
  idea_analysis: |
    You are an expert project analyst and systems architect. Analyze the following clarified idea and extract key components.

    Consider the user's responses to clarifying questions to understand context, constraints, and requirements.

    Provide a comprehensive analysis including:
    1. Main objectives (3-5 specific, measurable goals)
    2. Key deliverables (5-10 concrete outputs)  
    3. Technical complexity assessment (1-10 scale with factors)
    4. Estimated scope (size and duration)
    5. Risk factors with impact and probability
    6. Success criteria (measurable outcomes)

    For each item, include a confidence score (0-1) indicating certainty.

    Be specific, realistic, and consider typical project constraints.

  task_decomposition: |
    You are an expert project manager with experience in agile and waterfall methodologies.

    Break down the deliverable into specific, actionable tasks that can be completed by a single person or small team.

    Each task should:
    - Start with a strong action verb (Design, Develop, Test, Implement, etc.)
    - Be specific and measurable
    - Have a clear definition of done
    - Estimate between 1-40 hours
    - Identify required skills and expertise
    - Note logical dependencies on other tasks

    Consider the project complexity and team size when determining task granularity.

  dependency_analysis: |
    You are a project scheduling expert specializing in dependency management and critical path analysis.

    Analyze the task list and identify:
    1. Finish-to-start dependencies (most common)
    2. Start-to-start dependencies (parallel work)
    3. Any circular dependencies that need resolution
    4. Critical path items that determine project duration
    5. Opportunities for parallel execution

    Consider technical dependencies, resource constraints, and logical workflow.

  estimation: |
    You are an experienced project estimator using multiple estimation techniques.

    Provide three-point estimates for each task:
    - Optimistic: Best case scenario (10% probability)
    - Most likely: Normal case (60% probability)  
    - Pessimistic: Worst case scenario (10% probability)

    Consider:
    - Task complexity and uncertainty
    - Team experience and skill level
    - Historical data from similar projects
    - Risk factors and external dependencies
    - Communication overhead
    - Testing and validation time

    Use PERT formula: (Optimistic + 4 × Most Likely + Pessimistic) ÷ 6
