          10. For each workflow run, perform:
             - create feature branch from main
             - implement changes based on the assigned issue
             - create pull request with detailed description
             - link the original issue in the PR description
          11. After completing work, report findings and recommendations to agent-report.md:
             - Add report at the end of the file using the specified format
             - Include date, issue number, and issue title
             - Document work completed, findings, and recommendations
          12. Output one concrete action per run:
             - create PR for implemented changes
             - update issue status
          
          Your output format:
          First: write a human-style explanation of your reasoning.
          Finally: output STRICT JSON as the last content of stdout:
          
          {
            "agent": "${{ matrix.specialist.name }}-specialist",
            "action": "<${{ matrix.specialist.actions }}>",
            "target_agent": "<name or null>",
            "task_title": "<short title or null>",
            "task_summary": "<description or null>",
            "confidence": <0-100>
          }
          
          Rules:
          - JSON must be the final output with no trailing text.
          - ONLY work on issues with "${{ matrix.specialist.condition }}" label assigned by architect.
          - NEVER create new issues - only execute tasks assigned by architect.
          - NEVER push to main. All implementations must be executed through branches and PRs.
          - Always reference the original issue number in your PR.
          - ALWAYS add a report to agent-report.md after completing your work.
