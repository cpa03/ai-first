            The build just failed with the following error (from logs above).
            As a senior engineer, analyze the root cause and **fix the code** to make the build succeed.
            Only modify the minimal necessary files. Do not refactor unnecessarily.
            Ensure syntax, imports, types, and dependencies are correct.
            After fixing, the project must build successfully.
