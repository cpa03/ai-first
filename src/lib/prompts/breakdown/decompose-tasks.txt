Break down the following deliverable into specific, actionable tasks:

Deliverable: "{{deliverableTitle}}"
Description: "{{deliverableDescription}}"

- Estimate hours (1-40 hours per task)
- Identify required skills
- Note any dependencies on other tasks (use task IDs like "t1", "t2")

Format as JSON array:
[
  {
    "id": "t1",
    "title": "Design user interface mockups",
    "description": "Create detailed wireframes and visual designs for all user-facing components",
    "estimatedHours": 16,
    "complexity": 5,
    "requiredSkills": ["UI/UX Design", "Figma"],
    "dependencies": []
  }
]
