# Code Review & Refactoring Tasks

This document contains refactoring tasks identified during code review. Tasks are prioritized by impact and complexity.

## [COMPLETED] Extract Configuration Loading into Separate Service

- **Location**: `src/lib/agents/clarifier.ts`, `src/lib/agents/breakdown-engine.ts`
- **Issue**: Configuration loading logic is duplicated across agent classes. Both agents have nearly identical `loadConfig()` methods that read YAML files from the file system. This violates DRY principle and makes it harder to add new agents or change configuration sources.
- **Suggestion**: Create a `ConfigurationService` class that handles all configuration loading from YAML files. The service should:
  - Provide a single method `loadAgentConfig(agentName: string)` that returns typed config
  - Handle errors gracefully with fallback defaults
  - Support caching to avoid repeated file reads
  - Be testable without touching the filesystem
- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Reduces code duplication, improves testability, makes adding new agents easier

**Implementation**:

- Created `src/lib/config-service.ts` with `ConfigurationService` class
- Provides `loadAgentConfig<T>(agentName: string)` for typed configs
- Provides `loadAIModelConfig(agentName: string)` for AI configs
- Includes caching to avoid repeated file reads
- Graceful error handling with descriptive error messages
- Refactored both `clarifier.ts` and `breakdown-engine.ts` to use the service

## [REFACTOR] Extract Prompt Templates from Inline Strings

- **Location**: `src/lib/agents/clarifier.ts` (lines 126-150, 317-331), `src/lib/agents/breakdown-engine.ts` (lines 255-280, 314-339)
- **Issue**: Large prompt strings are embedded directly in the code, making them hard to maintain, version control, and A/B test. Prompts are not reusable and difficult to modify without code changes.
- **Suggestion**: Move all prompt templates to a dedicated `src/lib/prompts/` directory with a structure like:
  - `prompts/clarifier/generate-questions.txt`
  - `prompts/clarifier/refine-idea.txt`
  - `prompts/breakdown/analyze-idea.txt`
  - `prompts/breakdown/decompose-tasks.txt`

  Create a `PromptService` that loads and interpolates these templates. Support variable substitution using template literals.

- **Priority**: High
- **Effort**: Large
- **Impact**: Improves maintainability, enables A/B testing of prompts, separates concerns

## [REFACTOR] Extract Input Validation into Reusable Utilities

- **Location**: Multiple API routes (`src/app/api/clarify/start/route.ts`, etc.)
- **Issue**: Input validation is duplicated across API routes. Each route manually checks required fields and returns similar error responses. This is error-prone and inconsistent.
- **Suggestion**: Create a `ValidationService` or use a validation library like Zod or Joi. Implement:
  - Schema definitions for common input types (IdeaInput, ClarificationAnswer, etc.)
  - A middleware or higher-order function for request validation
  - Consistent error response formatting
  - Type-safe validation results
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Medium
- **Impact**: Improves code consistency, reduces bugs, better type safety

## [REFACTOR] Refactor AI Service to Separate Concerns

- **Location**: `src/lib/ai.ts`
- **Issue**: The `AIService` class handles multiple responsibilities: AI model calls, cost tracking, rate limiting, logging, and context management. This violates Single Responsibility Principle and makes the class large (304 lines) and hard to test.
- **Suggestion**: Split into separate, focused services:
  - `AIModelService`: Handles model calls and provider abstraction
  - `CostTrackerService`: Manages cost tracking and limits
  - `RateLimiterService`: Implements rate limiting
  - `ContextManagerService`: Handles context windowing
  - Keep `AIService` as a facade that orchestrates these services
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Effort**: Large
- **Impact**: Better separation of concerns, easier testing, more maintainable

## [REFACTOR] Remove Duplicate Fallback Questions Logic

- **Location**: `src/components/ClarificationFlow.tsx` (lines 62-86 and 96-113)
- **Issue**: The same fallback questions array is defined twice in the component - once when no questions are generated, and again when the API fails. This is clear duplication that makes maintenance harder.
- **Suggestion**: Extract the fallback questions into a constant at the top of the file:
  ```typescript
  const FALLBACK_QUESTIONS: Question[] = [
    { id: 'target_audience', question: 'Who is your target audience?', type: 'textarea' },
    { id: 'main_goal', question: 'What is the main goal you want to achieve?', type: 'textarea' },
    { id: 'timeline', question: 'What is your desired timeline for this project?', type: 'select', options: [...] },
  ];
  ```
  Then reference this constant in both places.
- **Priority**: Low
- **Effort**: Small
- **Impact**: Removes code duplication, improves maintainability
