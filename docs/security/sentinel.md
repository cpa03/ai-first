# Security Sentinel Log

This document tracks security vulnerabilities discovered and lessons learned to prevent future occurrences. Maintained by RepoKeeper as part of repository maintenance.

**Location:** Moved from `.jules/sentinel.md` to `docs/security/sentinel.md` for better visibility and documentation standards.

## 2025-05-15 - Stack Trace Leakage in PII Redaction

**Vulnerability:** The `redactPIIInObject` function in `src/lib/pii-redaction.ts` explicitly included the `stack` property when redacting `Error` objects. This information was then serialized and potentially sent to clients in API error responses (via `AppError.toJSON`).
**Learning:** While the tool was designed to redact PII (emails, keys, etc.) from objects, it inadvertently introduced a different security risk by including internal application structure (file paths, function names) which are contained in stack traces. The implementation prioritized debugging convenience over security by default.
**Prevention:** Always exclude sensitive internal metadata like stack traces from data structures that are intended for client-side consumption or general logging. If stack traces are needed for internal debugging, they should be handled via a separate, secure channel or restricted to non-production environments.

## 2025-05-18 - Gaps in PII Redaction for Modern API Keys and Payment Data

**Vulnerability:** The PII redaction utility and health check endpoint were missing common patterns for modern secrets (like AWS secret keys containing Base64 characters) and highly sensitive payment-related fields (CVV, CVC, PIN).
**Learning:** Standard alphanumeric regex patterns ([a-zA-Z0-9]) fail to capture many types of secrets that use full Base64 sets or other special characters. Additionally, centralized redaction lists must be kept in sync across diagnostic and logging utilities to prevent inconsistent data exposure.
**Prevention:** Use comprehensive regex patterns that include Base64 characters (`/`, `+`, `=`) for API key redaction. Centralize sensitive keyword lists used by both health checks and log redaction utilities to ensure consistent protection across the application.

## 2026-02-23 - Centralized Secure ID Generation

**Vulnerability:** Multiple locations in the codebase used `Math.random()` or manual `crypto` fallback logic for security-sensitive identifiers like session IDs and correlation IDs.
**Learning:** Inconsistent implementation of ID generation leads to security gaps where some parts of the system use cryptographically secure values while others use predictable ones.
**Prevention:** Use the centralized `generateSecureId()` utility in `src/lib/utils.ts` for all unique identifiers that require uniqueness or security. This utility provides a unified, "best-effort" secure approach using `crypto.randomUUID()` with robust environment-aware fallbacks.
