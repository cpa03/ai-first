### 3. Repository Hygiene Check

#### Tracked Files Analysis

| Category          | Status   | Notes                                   |
| ----------------- | -------- | --------------------------------------- |

| Cache directories | ✅ CLEAN | All properly gitignored                 |

#### Nested Dependencies

- `.opencode/node_modules/` (6.4MB): **NOT TRACKED** ✅
  - This directory is generated by OpenCode CLI
  - Properly excluded from git via parent `.gitignore`

### 4. Branch Hygiene

#### Merged Branches (Candidates for Deletion)

The following remote branches have been merged to `main` and can be safely deleted:

1. `origin/feature/tailwindcss-animate-micro-interactions`
2. `origin/fix/issue-549-task-id-extraction`

#### Active Branch Summary

Total remote branches: 72  
Recent activity (2026-02-12): 5 branches  
Oldest active: 2026-02-09

### 5. Documentation Status

#### Documentation Files Inventory

| Category           | Count | Status     |
| ------------------ | ----- | ---------- |
| Core documentation | 15    | ✅ Current |
| Engineer guides    | 11    | ✅ Current |
| API specifications | 1     | ✅ Current |
| Templates          | 3     | ✅ Current |
| Archive            | 1     | ✅ Current |

#### Duplicate Reports Identified

Two maintenance reports exist:

- `docs/repokeeper-report-2026-02.md` (381 lines)
- `docs/repokeeper-cleanup-report-2026-02.md` (260 lines)

**Note**: These are **NOT duplicates** - they contain different content:

- `repokeeper-report-2026-02.md`: Comprehensive monthly report
- `repokeeper-cleanup-report-2026-02.md`: Specific cleanup session report

**Recommendation**: Consolidate naming convention in future reports.
